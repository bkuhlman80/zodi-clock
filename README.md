# Helio‑Geo Zodiac Clock

The **Helio‑Geo Zodiac Clock** is an interactive web animation that visualizes the relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon within the tropical zodiac. It’s designed to be both visually compelling and phase-accurate for key lunar events.

## Features
- **Animated Mode:** Watch the Earth orbit the Sun in **123.7 seconds** (a visual year) and the Moon complete its synodic orbit in **10 seconds**.
- **Frozen Mode:** Select any UTC date and time to see the Sun and Moon positions for that moment.
- **Phase Accuracy:** The Moon’s position is calculated based on its synodic phase relative to the Sun, so full moons appear directly opposite the Sun on the correct dates.
- **Zodiac Ring:** Displays all 12 tropical signs with real-time Sun and Moon pointers.

## How to Use
- Click **Animated** to watch continuous motion.
- Click **Frozen** to pause and manually set a date/time.
- Use the visual rays from Earth to the Sun and Moon to understand their zodiac positions.
