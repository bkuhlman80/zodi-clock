# Z0DI Clock

The **Z0DI Clock** is an interactive web animation that visualizes the relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon within the tropical zodiac. It’s designed to be both visually compelling and phase-accurate for key lunar events.

## Notes
- This is an educational visualization, not a precision astronomical tool.
- Tropical zodiac positions are shown from a geocentric perspective, with accurate phase relationships between the Sun and Moon.

## Development vs Deployment

This repo uses **Vite** to build static assets into the `/docs` folder, which GitHub Pages serves.

### Source files (edit these)

* `src/clock.js` → main JavaScript module.
* `index.html` and `embed.html` in the repo **root** → templates that reference `/src/clock.js`.

### Build output (do not edit)

* `docs/index.html` and `docs/embed.html` → generated by Vite.
* `docs/clock-[hash].js` → cache-busted build artifact.
* GitHub Pages is configured to serve from **main /docs**.

## Workflow

1. Edit source files in `src/` or root HTML.

2. Run the deploy script:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This will:

   * Run `vite build` → outputs new files into `/docs/`
   * Stage all changes
   * Commit with a timestamp, e.g. `deploy 2025-08-26 12:47:00`
   * Push to `main` (triggering Pages deploy)

3. Visit the live site:

   * Main page: [https://bkuhlman80.github.io/helio-geo-zodiac/](https://bkuhlman80.github.io/helio-geo-zodiac/)
   * Embed view: [https://bkuhlman80.github.io/helio-geo-zodiac/embed.html](https://bkuhlman80.github.io/helio-geo-zodiac/embed.html)

## Verification

* After a successful deploy, open **View Page Source** on the live site.
* You should see a script like:

  ```html
  <script type="module" crossorigin src="/helio-geo-zodiac/clock-DofenHXy.js"></script>
  ```
* Each new build generates a different `[hash]`, ensuring browsers always pull the latest code.

## Troubleshooting

* **Deployment stuck**: Go to GitHub → Actions → cancel/re-run the latest *Pages build and deployment* job.
* **Wrong HTML served**: Confirm GitHub Pages is set to `main /docs` in repo settings.
* **Browser shows old files**: Hard refresh with cache disabled (DevTools → Network → Disable cache → Reload).
